>>> Chapter One (Luz tanoy). 

Ordinal numbers are formed by adding -eaf to the number stem. Anything that gives meaning to a noun comes after it. 

Luz (1-eaf) taneaf >> The First (1st) Chapter. 

YASA >> THE FAMILY 

Ayik is a person.
-ye is the masculine suffix.
-ya is the feminine suffix.
We can skip suffixes if something else in the sentence indicates the gender. 

ti >> to be
tÃ­ >> I am
til >> you (sg) are
tir >> he, she, it is
tit >> we (incl) are
tic >> you (pl) are
tid >> they are
tiv >> we (excl) are

Sentence order is usually Object-Subject-Verb, but for the copula (to be), it's Subject-Verb-Attribute.  

weltik >> Mr./Mrs.
pintik >> baby (0-2 years old)
rumeik >> child (general non adult)

Smith weltikye tir ayikye >> Mr. Smith is a man.

If a noun ends in a vowel, the word that classifies it takes the same vowel for harmony. With the exception of proper nouns (I think).

tanoya rumeikya >> one (1) girl 
toloya rumeikya >> two (2) girls 
tanoy velik >> one (1) child 
toloy velik >> two (2) children
